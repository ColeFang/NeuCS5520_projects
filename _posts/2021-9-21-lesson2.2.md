**Summary**

In this lesson, I learned different states and lifecycle of an activity.
The Activity lifecycle is a set of states an Activity migrates through, beginning when it is first created and ending when the Android system reclaims the resources for that Activity.  
As the user navigates from one Activity to another, and inside and outside of your app, each Activity moves between states in the Activity lifecycle.  
Each state in the Activity lifecycle has a corresponding callback method you can override in your Activity class.

1. If you run the homework app before implementing onSaveInstanceState(), what happens if you rotate the device? Choose one:

The counter is reset to 0, but the contents of the EditText is preserved.

2. What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs? Choose one:

Android shuts down your Activity by calling onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(), and then starts it over again, calling onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume().


3. When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called? Choose one:

onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method.


4. Which Activity lifecycle methods are best to use for saving data before the Activity is finished or destroyed? Choose one:

onPause() or onStop()
