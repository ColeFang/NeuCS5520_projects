**Summary**

In this lesson, I learned how to open a website url, how to open google map and how to implement the share function. 
I also have a deeper understanding about activities and intents  
An implicit Intent allows you to activate an Activity if you know the action, but not the specific app or Activity that will handle that action.  
An Activity that can receive an implicit Intent must define Intent filters in the AndroidManifest.xml file that match one or more Intent actions and categories.
