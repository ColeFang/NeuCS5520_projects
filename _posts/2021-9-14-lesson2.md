**Summary**

In this lesson, I learned the conception of View, ViewGroup, and layouts: 

All UI elements are subclasses of the View class and therefore inherit many properties of the View superclass.

View elements can be grouped inside a ViewGroup, which acts as a container. The relationship is parent-child, in which the parent is a ViewGroup, and the child is a View or another ViewGroup.

I also learned how to use the layout editor to edit the attributes of different UI elements and the connection between the layout editor and the code.

In the End, I learned how to extract string resources and create new activities like click handler.
