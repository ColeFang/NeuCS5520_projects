**Summary**


####In the final project, I want to extend the ToDo app. My improvements can be mainly separated to three part:

###1.Improve the UI 

To start with, I want to improve the visual design of the UI and made it a pleasure to use the ToDo app. I will replace the background for the app and change the design of several EditView which are used for entering details. The final page may look like this.

Even though a wonderful visual design is the base to an app, If the UI are convenient to use is also an important part for an app. I want to improve the design of adding and canceling tasks. Users can check the detail for a task by just click on it and they can just slide the task left to cancel it. The color of the task will also be changed to gray when users select the “finished” box, so that the app will show the complement situation for each task more clearly.

###2.Improve the reminders.

Now the reminder in the ToDo app have a fatal problem, which is overwriting the last alarm when user choose to build a new reminder. I will solve this problem so that users can set as many alarms as they want. 

Also the UI of the reminder looks kind of shabby now, I will put more icons and color in it to make it more striking and interesting. The final result may look like this.

Last, if I have spare time, I want to implement a function: when user click on the notification, this notification will bring user to the corresponding page in the ToDo app to show the detail of this task.

###3.Launch system build database for user

To make this app more personalized, I want to build a register system and a local database for different users to login in. With this function, users can have their own task list and no conflicts with others. And Security for the personal account and passcode will be very important in this part. I may use Firebase to achieve this function.
