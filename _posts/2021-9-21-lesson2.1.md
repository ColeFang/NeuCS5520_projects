**Summary**

In this lesson, I learned the concept of activity and intent.
An Activity is an app component that provides a single screen focused on a single user task.
Each Activity has its own user interface layout file.
You can assign your Activity implementations a parent/child relationship to enable Up navigation within your app.
A View can be made visible or invisible with the android:visibility attribute.
I also learned how to create a new activity and how to trigger it by click a button.
