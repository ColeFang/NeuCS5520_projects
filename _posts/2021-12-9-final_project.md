# Summary


## In the final project, I extended the ToDo app. My improvements can be mainly separated to four part:

### 1.Improve the UI 

To start with, I improved the visual design of the UI and made it a pleasure to use the ToDo app. I replaced the background for the app and changed the design of several EditView which are used for entering details. The final pages look like this.

Even though a wonderful visual design is the base to an app, If the UI are convenient to use is also an important part for an app. I improved the design of adding and canceling tasks. Users now can check the detail for a task by just click on it and they can just slide the task left to cancel it.

### 2.Improve the reminders.

One month ago, the reminder in the ToDo app had a fatal problem, which is overwriting the last alarm when user choose to build a new reminder. I solved this problem so that users can set as many alarms as they want. 

Also the UI of the reminder looks better now. The final result look like this.

Last but not least, I implemented the function: when user click on the notification, this notification will bring user to the corresponding page in the ToDo app to show the detail of this task.

### 3.Enable the access to notification
I added a window to remind users enable the access to notification.

### 4.Quick use  
I added some icons which users can click to generate template tasks quickly, which I think is very useful and convenient for customers.
