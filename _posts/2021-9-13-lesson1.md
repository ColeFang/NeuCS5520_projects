**Summary**

In this lesson, I installed Android Studio and learned some basic skills to create a new app and a virtual device for testing my app. I also learned how to run the app on my phone.

I also have a basic understanding about the structure of the project pane and the meaning of each .xml or .java file.

The most important thing is I built my first app! Here is my achievement:
